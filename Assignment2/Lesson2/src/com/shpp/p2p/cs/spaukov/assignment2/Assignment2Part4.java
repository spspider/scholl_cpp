/*
 * TODO:Many countries have such flags that simply consist of three colored stripes of the same size (horizontal or vertical).
 *   Among them: Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Chad, France, Gabon, Germany, Guinea, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg,
 *   Mali, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Peru, Romania, Russia, Yemen, well, and Ukraine, of course‚Ä¶ I'm kidding üòÉ * ‚Ä¶ Plus a few others,
 *   but in general, it doesn't matter!*  * Your task: to write a program that draws such flags.
 *   The size of the flag is regulated by constants, it must be centered in the middle of the window. The inscription
 *   ‚ÄúFlag of‚Äú ‚Äùshould also be at the bottom right. In Art and Science of Java, you'll probably find tips on how
 *   to calculate text size to position GLabel correctly.
